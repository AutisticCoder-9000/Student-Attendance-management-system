# Student-Attendance-management-system
This is a simple program for a student attendance management system using Object oriented programming for our C++ project

<br>

## This program utilises the following object-oriented concepts from C++

```
1. Classes with inheritance

2. Parameterized and delegating constructors

3. Defining your own namespaces

4. inline functions (implictly declared)

5. Static members in a class

6. Vectors

7. Lambda functions

8. Friend function

9. Abstract classes

10. Exception handling

```
Furthermore, it also uses File handling to store the data. (It's stored in a CSV file)

<br>

This program enables the user to add Student, Mark attendance and view all information about the student. The default attendance percentage is set to 75%, which can be changed to any threshold depending upon the user's requirement.
